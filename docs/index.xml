      <description>Potentially interesting sites This only works for PSU-based people  Open this spreadsheet.
It has the following columns:
 Group: People, to whom variants are assigned Sample: SRA accession CHROM: Reference genome (same for all rows) POS: Position of the variant in the genome (1-based) REF: Reference allele ALT: Alternative allele DP: Read depth AF: Alternative allele frequency SB: Strand bias as calculated by lofreq (0 = no strand bias) DP4: Strand-specific depth for reference and alternate allele observations (Forward reference, reverse reference, forward alternate, reverse alternate) IMPACT: functional impact of the substitution FUNCLASS: type of change EFFECT: effect of the change GENE: gene name CODON: codon type: type of variant (S = SNP, I = Indel, M = MNP ) GENE: gene name SITE: codon within the gene FEL: Is site identified by FEL as being under selection MEME: Is site identified by MEME as being under selection MEME.</description>

      <description>A quick overview of coronavirus molecular biology Given the current situation we will continue this class using SARS-COV-2 as example for all further analyses. So far we have covered variant calling and genome assembly. Next we will be looking into RNAseq. Since SARS-COV-2 is a positive strand RNA virus that pretends to be a typical human transcript, it is a great system to learn about RNAseq. But first we need to learn about the coronavirus molecular biology.</description>

      <description>Genome assembly is a difficult task. In trying to explain it I will be relying on two primary sources:
 Ben Langmead&amp;rsquo;s Teaching Materials Pevzner and Compeau Bioinformatics Book  Genomes and reads: Strings and k-mers k-mer composition Genomes are strings of text. When we sequence genomes we use sequencing machines that generate reads. For now let&amp;rsquo;s assume that all reads have the same length k and every k-mer is sequenced only once.</description>

      <description>WarmUp with Python Numbers  Open this notebook Make a copy of it in your drive Go through it and execute all cells  In the previous lecture we uploaded data and performed QC. The outcome of this analysis is a set of Illumina reads that are ready to be mapped. Before we map we should understand the theory behind this process.
Mapping versus alignment One possible idea on how to speed things up will be to first find most likely locations for each read and them refine alignments as necessary.</description>

      <description>WarmUp with Python Strings  Open this notebook Make a copy of it in your drive Go through it and execute all cells  The project The goal of our project will be finding a perfect variant caller for non-diploid data (e.g., viral, bacterial, organellar).
For this we will use two datasets:
 An HIV resequencing data from the DC cohort study A duplex sequencing dataset from an experimental evolution study  The idea is to use duplex data as the &amp;ldquo;golden standard&amp;rdquo; and then apply the best caller we find to HIV data and see if we can find anything interesting.</description>

      <description>The 50s, 60s and the 70s The difficulty with sequencing nucleic acids is nicely summarized by Hutchinson:2007:
  The chemical properties of different DNA molecules were so similar that it appeared difficult to separate them. The chain length of naturally occurring DNA molecules was much greater than for proteins and made complete sequencing seems unapproachable. The 20 amino acid residues found in proteins have widely varying properties that had proven useful in the separation of peptides.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Notebooks An important assumption for this lecture is that (1) you have a Google account, (2) know how to use Google Drive, and (3) also have an active GitHub account.  When you start an analysis, you don&amp;rsquo;t really know how it will go. Maybe data is bad and there is no real reason to analyze anything at all. Maybe data data outliers that need to be dealt with.</description>
